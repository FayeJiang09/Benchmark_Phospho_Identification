# Benchmark_Phospho_Identification
Deep learning-derived evaluation metrics enable effective benchmarking of computational tools for phosphopeptide identification

We investigated three deep learning-derived features as potential evaluation metrics: phosphosite probability, Delta RT and spectral similarity. Predicted phosphosite probability is computed by MusiteDeep, which provides high accuracy as previously reported; Delta RT is defined as the absolute retention time (RT) difference between RTs observed and predicted by AutoRT; and spectral similarity is defined as the Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient between spectra observed and predicted by pDeep2.

The benchmark metrics demonstrated in this study will enable users to select computational pipelines and parameters for routine analysis of phosphoproteomics data and will offer guidance for developers to improve computational methods.
